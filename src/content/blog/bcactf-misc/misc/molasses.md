## Molasses

> This GIF shows the flag letter-by-letter but it's really slow and I don't want to wait all day. Maybe there's a faster way to get the flag?

Just extract GIF to frames

i use this https://ezgif.com/split

<div class="flag-component">
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M22 11.08V12a10 10 0 1 1-5.93-9.14"></path><polyline points="22 4 12 14.01 9 11.01"></polyline></svg>
  <div class="content">Flag: bcactf{is_it_gif_or_gif_a51fd7ace416}</div>
</div>
