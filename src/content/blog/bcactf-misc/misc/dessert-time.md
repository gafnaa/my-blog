Match with Clue: The letters that make up “Apple pie” appear at times that match your clues:

Morning: Most of the letters that make up “Apple pie” appear on the morning schedule (between 4am and 10am).
Evening: Some of the letters “e” also appear at night, which matches the clue “snack at night”.

Flag name: The characters that appear before the curly brackets { are b, c, a, c, t, f. Combined, these characters form the flag name: bcactf.

Flag Contents: The characters that come between { and } are A, p, l, e, _, p, i, e, S, _, A, r, e, y, u, M, M, y.

If these characters are rearranged, they will form a sensible sentence that relates to the previous answer:
Apple_pieS_Are_yuMMy (Apple pies are yummy).
